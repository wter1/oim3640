# Session 2 (1/22) - [Version_Control_And_Github]

## What I learned today
I learned a lot about using git and it's relevancies! I've always heard about it but have actually never gotten too deep into it before so this was an exciting class. This is also the first time I'm using VSCode.

## Code/work I'm proud of (optional)
print('hello, world!') is the only line of code we did in this class that I can recall, but I think even the smallest things matter!

## Challenges I faced
There were no particular challenges for me this class, though if you were to ask me to explain the lines of code that Professor Li presented in class I would not be able to. I didn't really have any questions about it though not because I didn't have any, rather I really did just not know what to ask with such and influx of information. I am confident however that going through this class will help me understand a lot more by the end of it.

## AI usage (if any)
No AI usage in this class

## Questions for next time
In class Professor Li brought up that using 'pip' wasn't really the best way to download dependencies. What would be then? or is there really any 'best' way?
