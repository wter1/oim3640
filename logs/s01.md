# Session 1 (1/20) - [Introduction]

## What I learned today
Of course this day was essentially a syllabus day like other courses, but I was able to grasp the main idea of what we'll be going over in this course. In relation to the 'Problem to Prototype' assignment that we did in class, my prompt was as follows: "Create an app that displays relevant banking information for easy access." I am rather forgetful, and really do not check my bank balance as much as I should, so having an app (more specifically a widget) that can be displayed on my homescreen to show me my balance and any recent transactions would help me a lot!
