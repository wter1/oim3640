# Session 4 (1/29) - [Functions]

## What I learned today
##### Chapter 3: Functions 
###### Summary
This chapter mainly went over functions with the most important part being why even use function in the first place. My first reaction to it before having read the textbook or arrived to class is that functions reduces *redundancy* which might be weird to say since python is a formal language, but as I think about it, why would you write 10 lines of code over and over again whenever you'd need to when you could just write the 10 lines once in a function and then call upon it whenever you want in the future with just one line of code. 

After having read the textbook, it seems to be in line with what I thought the function of a *function* might be. Functions make code easier to read, eliminates repetative code, allows for debugging in bite sized bits, and you'd be able to reuse function on many programs not just the one you created it in. 

###### Glossary

- *Function Definition*: As the name implies, you're defining some new function and what that function will do by writing some sequence of statements inside. 
    - *def*: This is the keyword that enables the creation of new definition. See the anatomy of it below:
        - *Header*: The first line of the function definition 
        - *Body* The following sequence of statements
- *Function Object*: The newly created function from your function definition
- *Parameter*: The argument that you make require when creating a function definition
- *Repetition*: If you ever want to repeat something, you'd use some function for repetition
    - *for*: A for statement is one of the basic building blocks of python. It's header structure is: *for i in range(n): ...* where i is index and the range of n starts counting from 0. 
    - **Note**: You can put a for loop inside a function
- *Local*: something you've created that only exsists withing another thing. In this case a variable created withing a function is *local* to that function
- *Stack Diagram*: Similar to state diagrams, but this one can show the value inside a variable and the function the variable belongs to. 
    - *Frame*: A box with the function on the outside and *local* variables on the inside
- *Traceback*: Shows function that was running when error occured, the function that called it and the so on.
